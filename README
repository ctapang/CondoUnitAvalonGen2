We are putting this up as another entry in the contest. All design materials will be made available to the public if we win Avalon's contest.

Features

•Converts Gen2's CONFIG and REPORT signals into high-speed SPI protocol for direct connection to SPI pins of on-board PIC32 Microcontroller.
•Power supply voltage is software-adjustable from 0.9V to 1.1V, in 64 steps. We used the LM10011 from TI for this.
•Card has on-board USB controller, available through the PIC32MX chip.
•Uses PIC32MX microcontroller, which has on-chip SPI and USB peripherals.
•Uses only high slew-rate SN74LVC glue logic.
•Compatible with either BFGMiner or CGMiner.
•Temperature monitoring using the PIC32MX on-chip thermometer.
•Uses a 25.000MHz oscillator module (instead of a crystal and low slew-rate logic used in ref design) for more reliable operation.
•Same form-factor as original Gen1 hash card so that the same heat-sink can be used.
