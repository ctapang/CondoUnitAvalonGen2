Condo Unit PCB and Firmware

Features

�Converts Gen2's CONFIG and REPORT signals into high-speed SPI protocol for direct connection to SPI pins of on-board PIC32 Microcontroller.
�Power supply voltage is software-adjustable from 0.9V to 1.1V, in 64 steps. We used the LM10011 from TI for this.
�Card has on-board USB controller, available through the PIC32MX chip.
�Uses PIC32MX microcontroller, which has on-chip SPI and USB peripherals.
�Uses only high slew-rate SN74LVC glue logic.
�Compatible with either BFGMiner or CGMiner.
�Temperature monitoring using the PIC32MX on-chip thermometer.
�Uses a 25.000MHz oscillator module (instead of a crystal and low slew-rate logic used in ref design) for more reliable operation.
�Same form-factor as original Gen1 hash card so that the same heat-sink can be used.

Status as of Dec. 2, 2013

We are just about to receive this revision of the PCB design from the assembler today. We have written an initial version of the firmware for the PIC32MX micro-controller, and are just about to test it. We figure we need a couple more days to get it hashing.
